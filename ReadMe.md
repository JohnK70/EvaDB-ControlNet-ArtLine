# EvaDB Project 1
This project takes in a profile image of a person and converts it to an lineart sketch. EvaDB is utilized to perform CV2 functions through queries on an image. For now this project focused on converting an image through EvaDB into lineart, but will focus on increasing the complexity in the future.

## Example Output:

### Running the app:
Clone the github repo into your desired location. Then use <pip install -r requirements.txt> inside the directory to install requirements.

There are two folders related to the repository: Images and TestImages.
TestImages holds all images that you want to use later. Use this for storing any images. It will not be used when running the code.
Images will hold the single image you want to convert into lineart.

To use the app, make sure the Images folder is clear except for the one image you want to turn into lineart.
After this, you can run the app by running the file EvaDBArtline.py
MatPlotLib will then display the outputted lineart image. This will be deleted once you close out of the image, so if you want to save it you must do so manually.
