### EvaDB Project 1

This project attempts to recreate LineArt using EvaDB.
Running the app requires setting up EvaDB locally in a virtual environment, then running the EvaDBArtline.py file

Note: Only the first image in the Images folder will be displayed. All other images should be kept in TestImages for future use.
