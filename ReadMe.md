# EvaDB Project 1
This project takes in a profile image of a person and converts it to an lineart sketch. EvaDB is utilized to perform CV2 functions through queries on an image. For now this project focused on converting an image through EvaDB into lineart, but will focus on increasing the complexity in the future.
